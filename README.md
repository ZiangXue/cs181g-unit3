next steps:
- auto-spawn of terrian. Fix G and have boxes spawn and move @ negative z speed towards player.
- fixed direction orbit / FP model.
- HP and removal.
(Should we switch to vector of item for retaining?)
One way to do this is to keep track of to-be-deleted indices and pop with descending order.

todo: enable collision detection & handling for boxes.
todo: implement deletion of items Game.
